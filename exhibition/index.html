        <h2>Curatorial Statement</h2>
        <p>The mid-1990s marked a transformative period in art history, as the internet emerged as a novel medium for
            creative expression. This exhibition, "Digital Pioneers: The Genesis of Net Art," delves into the
            groundbreaking works that defined the early days of net art. By featuring seminal pieces from platforms such
            as Alt-X, Art Teleportacia, and bram.org, we explore how artists harnessed the web's potential to challenge
            traditional art forms, foster interactive experiences, and critique digital culture. These creations not
            only expanded the boundaries of artistic expression but also laid the groundwork for contemporary digital
            practices. Through this collection, we invite viewers to reflect on the transformative power of the internet
            and its enduring impact on art.</p>
